# Convert HEIC to JPEG

Do you have a folder full of HEIC files?

Do you want them to be JPEG files instead?

All you need is [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) installed, for the `convert` utility.

Then run the command with `-d`irectory the HEIC files are in and `-o`utput directory where you'd like the JPEG files to be.
