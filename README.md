## golang-learning

I'm using this repo to track progress while doing Todd McLeod's [Udemy course for golang](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/)


This is just for me to keep track of what I'm doing, you should really go [take the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/) yourself!


### Notes

* Exercises start at lesson 15
* 1 folder per lesson will be created, with optional subfolders if there are multiple disparate exercises
